## 1. Simplicity
  * [ ] Write sample client code in the README:
    * E.g. Pendulum's README starts with [sample code](https://github.com/sdispater/pendulum).
  * [ ] Reduce boilerplate code: count the number of lines up to first really useful API call:
    * E.g. urllib2 has [lots of boilerplate code](https://gist.github.com/kennethreitz/973705) to do an HTTP request compared to Requests library.
  * [ ] Document use cases:  
    * E.g. [python-social-auth document common use-cases](http://python-social-auth-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases.html).
  * [ ] Practice [Progressive disclosure:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure)
    * [ ] Have default arguments and decide their values according to the most common use cases.
    * [ ] Have default settings and decide their values according to the most common use cases.
    * [ ] Decide argument order by listing the most used ones first and grouping related ones together.
      * E.g. JavaScript [`history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#The_pushState()_method) has bad default argument order: `state, title, URL`. Most API clients just want to add a URL to the history and they're forced to specify state and title.
    * [ ] Don't require copy and pasting of code snippets.
  * [ ] Avoid cumbersome inputs:
    * [ ] Check if parameter name is misleading.
      * E.g. In Scrapy 1.2, the send method accepts a "to" parameter as a list of strings. If the client passes a single string, the method will iterate over the string, trying to send emails to each character of it. Scrapy 1.3 fixed this by accepting both a single string and a list of strings.
    * [ ] Check if the user is instantiating something just to call the API. If so, consider accepting the wrapped value.  
        * E.g. a function that only accepts file-like objects will force clients to use `StringIO` if they want to pass strings.
    * [ ] Check if it's possible to replace a custom type with a built-in one, or support both.
  * [ ] Respect the [Principle of least astonishment:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)
    * "If a feature has a high astonishment factor, it may be necessary to redesign it".
    * [ ] The default behavior does what clients expect?
    * [ ] The default behavior matches client expectations about performance, side-effects, safety, security, restrictions, etc?
  * [ ] Create abstractions:
    * [ ] Draw away from the physical HOW nature of the solution to focus on the WHAT nature.  
      * E.g. to make a simple Celery task, devs don't need to worry much about task queues, workers, message brokers, serialization, etc. They just need to use the `@app.task` decorator. The API is focused on the task definition, not on the tasks inner-workings.
    * [ ] Is the API abstracting something it shouldn't be? Be careful with [The Law of Leaky Abstractions.](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)  
      * E.g. [RPC is almost naturally bad](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/22/three-wrong-ideas-from-computer-science/) because it abstracts remote resources as local ones, but those should really be handled differently from local ones.
  * [ ] Be Pythonic:
    * [ ] Strive for common Python idioms, try to make API calls look like built-in Python API calls.
      * E.g. in Python 2, [`ConfigParser.get`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html#ConfigParser.RawConfigParser.get) receives a `section` and `option`. This isn't natural in Python since `get` of `dict` receives `key` and `default` value. In Python 3, this was fixed by introducing a [dict-like interface to `ConfigParser`.](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/configparser.html#mapping-protocol-access)

## 2. Consistency
  * [ ] Naming: is there naming consistency between the API and the Python ecosystem?
    * Follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the official style guide for Python code. To guarantee adherence to [Naming Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) and other style constraints, validate the API code with [flake8.](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
  * [ ] Naming: is there naming consistency inside the API?
    * [ ] Order of terms: `string_encode` vs `decode_string`.
    * [ ] Abbreviations: `activate_prev` vs `fetch_previous`, `bin2hex` vs `strtolower`.
    * [ ] With or without underscore: `gettype` vs `get_class`.
    * [ ] Plurals: `values_list` vs `value_list`.
    * [ ] Negatives: `button.enabled == True` vs `button.disabled == True`.
  * [ ] Emptiness: is there consistency in the meaning of the empty value? Is it the best representation?
    * [ ] Decide what will be used as empty: `None`, `False`, `[]`, `''`, `0`, etc.
    * [ ] Be careful with unexpected falsy values: `bool(datetime.time(0)) == False` in Python < 3.5.
  * [ ] Parameters: is there consistency in the order of parameters?  
    * E.g. `datetime.datetime(year, month, day, minute, second, microsecond)` vs `datetime.timedelta(days, seconds, microseconds, milliseconds, minutes, hours, weeks)`.
  * [ ] Behavior: is there consistency in the representation of similar and different behaviors? Asymmetry of behavior should reflect in asymmetry of form:
    * E.g. Good: `numbers.sort()` in-place vs `sorted(numbers)` not-in-place.


## 3. Flexibility:
  * [ ] Reduce [integration discontinuities:](https://mollyrocket.com/casey/stream_0028.html)
    * [ ] Check if classes have a [single responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle). If not, break them into multiple classes:
      * E.g. a class to get/set items from/to a cache should separate the behavior to connect to the cache server into another class.
    * [ ] Check if function name has "and" or implies multiple operations. If so, consider breaking into multiple functions. However, keep the combined one if it's used by most clients:  
      * E.g. `print_formatted` function should be broken into two: `print` and `formatted`.
    * [ ] Check if the API client has to copy-and-paste code to change some behavior. Provide hooks, methods to be overridden, instead.
    * [ ] Check if an attribute used internally in class behavior could be a `get_something` method: 
      * E.g. on Django REST Framework, the CursorPagination class supported only a fixed `page_size`, because it didn't have the `get_page_size` method. This was [changed](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/pull/3147) by introducing the method.
    * [ ] Avoid hiding parameters that could be useful:
      * E.g. the API is calling another lower-level one, but it isn't exposing some useful parameters the lower-level API supports.
    * [ ] Return everything the API client might need.
    * [ ] Pass everything the API client might need when calling it's code (when [Inversion of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) is in place).
    * [ ] Evaluate every `mock.patch` in the API tests. This indicates something isn't flexible to be changed at runtime. Consider having parameters to change those things.
      * E.g. Python's built-in [sched.scheduler](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/sched.html) accepts `timefunc` and `delayfunc`, so the tests don't need to mock `time.monotonic` nor `time.sleep` and the clients can change those behaviors.
  * [ ] Create abstractions:
    * [ ] Wrap resources and functionalities common to multiple low-level implementations.  
      * E.g. Beautiful Soup provides the same API for [multiple parsers.](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-a-parser)
    * [ ] Provide multiple abstraction levels, from the most simple to the most customizable:  
      * E.g. Celery supports both the `@app.task` decorator and a [custom task class](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/tasks.html#custom-task-classes) that inherits from `celery.Task`.
    * [ ] Provide the ability to get out of the abstraction cage and use the abstracted resources and functionalities directly: 
      * E.g. Django querysets support `.extra` to combine custom SQL with ORM-generated one. It also supports `.raw`, which allow completely raw SQL queries.
    * [ ] Wrap errors that are common to multiple low-level implementations and avoid leaking them directly to the API client:
      * E.g. a database connection error should be the same if the API supports multiple database engines. This helps API clients to change engines without changing much code.
  * [ ] Be Pythonic:
    * [ ] Use properties for simple getters and setters.
    * [ ] Use magic methods for operator overloading.
    * [ ] Use `__repr__` magic method for simpler debug.
    * [ ] Use with-statement contexts for open-close/start-end lifecycle.
    * [ ] Use decorators to easily compose common behaviors or register something.
    * [ ] Use iterators for lazy iterables.
    * [ ] Use generators to intertwine logic.
    * [ ] Use asyncio for async code.
    * [ ] Use built-in collections instead of custom repositories.
    * [ ] Accept simple high-order functions for simple Inversion of Control:
        * E.g. `list.sort` accepts `key` as the ranker function to calculate the order.
    * [ ] For complex flows, consider function/class pipelines, inheritance or generators, in that order:
        * E.g. pipelines: [python-social-auth pipelines](http://python-social-auth-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pipeline.html?highlight=pipelines), inheritance: [Django class-based views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/class-based-views/), generators: [Scrapy spiders.](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html)
    * [ ] Respect [duck-typing and "Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission".](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-duck-typing)
  * [ ] Internationalize (I18N) the strings the end-user will see.

## 4. Safety
  * [ ] Check for warning words like "warning", "careful", "remember to", "don't forget" in docs while describing a behavior. If they are there, consider changing behavior to be safer.
  * [ ] Detect common mistakes and use Python's built-in [warnings](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/warnings.html) module to log warnings about them.
  * [ ] Require unsafe behavior to be explicit:
    * E.g. Don't show all if something isn't set. `fields = None` shouldn't mean all fields.
  * [ ] Don't connect code implicitly by name or module. Use a registry or a registry-decorator:
    * E.g. django-admin [registry](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/admin/), which supports both register by function or by decorator.
  * [ ] Avoid depending on order of method calls, try to use with-statement contexts instead.
  * [ ] Fail-fast: crap in crap out is not a Pythonic idea:
    * [ ] Raise `ValueError` if the library receives an invalid argument, like something that overflows, has a wrong format or is in a wrong state.
    * [ ] Raise `TypeError` if the library receives an argument with incompatible type, like a `duck` that doesn't `quack`. But don't do it inside a `if isinstance(duck, LibDuck)` or `if type(duck) == LibDuck`)! First try to call `quack`, then raise `TypeError` if it fails to give a clearer error.

## 5. Conclusion
  * [ ] My API tries to make the simple easy, the complex possible and the wrong impossible.

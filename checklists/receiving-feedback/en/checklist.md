## Before

* [ ] Prepare yourself by getting into a calm and **reflective mindset**
* [ ] **Don't create expectations** of what the feedback should be
    * It’s not the giver’s role to say what you want to hear, but offer you a different perspective other than your own.

## During

* [ ] **Actively listen** to what they are saying
    * It requires you as the listener to fully concentrate, understand, and then remember what is being said.
* [ ] Provide **small responses** to show that you are listening and understanding
    * Eye contact, nodding your head, and saying small things like "I see", "I hear you", "Yep", or even "Hmm" are indicators that you are following the conversation.
* [ ] **Don't dismiss** or react to feedback at the moment it's being given
    * Try to absorb, understand, and reflect upon it. Sometimes, after a while, something that didn’t make sense then, makes sense now. Take your time!
* [ ] **Be open** and understanding of other perspectives
    * One of the key goals of receiving feedback is to become aware of something you didn’t notice by yourself because of your own blind spots.
* [ ] Control your emotions and **don't freak out**
    * You may be surprised, but don’t be reactive.
* [ ] Mind your facial expressions and body language
* [ ] Ask follow-up or **clarification questions** when necessary
* [ ] Welcome and embrace unexpected feedbacks
    * You may not have asked for it, but **still may be useful**.
* [ ] Show empathy and respect for their point of view
* [ ] Show appreciation by **thanking them for their feedback**
    * Even if you realize it doesn’t make sense to you, you still got the opportunity to consider something otherwise you probably wouldn’t have thought about.

## After

* [ ] Reflect upon what was said and figure out what makes sense for you
    * You are not bound to act on every feedback you get. You are allowed to drop it if it doesn’t make sense for you.
* [ ] **Prioritize** and choose which feedback you are going to focus first
    * Don’t try to tackle everything at once, nobody expects you to be perfect.
* [ ] Make an action or learning plan to **apply changes**
* [ ] Look for **guidance** and validation
* [ ] Set **acceptance criteria** as a definition of done for each feedback
* [ ] Align and **manage** feedback stakeholders expectations of your development

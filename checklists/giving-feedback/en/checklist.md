## Before

* [ ] Prepare feedback by **answering** their questions
* [ ] **Explore** other possible situations beyond the ones asked
* [ ] Make sure to evaluate **strengths**, **weaknesses**, and **gray areas**
* [ ] **Write down** bullet points of what you wish to say
* [ ] Organize **feedback structure**: how to begin, develop, and end
    * Elaborate how this information will be easier to process, and then build a cohesive, empathetic, and logical timeline for your feedback.
* [ ] Check for possible **partial opinions**, the unseen,  or **biases** you may have
    * If you are giving feedback to someone who is part of a marginalized group, think about if you would feel the same way if it was a white cisgender, middle-class man. Is it still valid and applicable?
* [ ] Review to make sure it's **actionable** and **achievable**
* [ ] Optional: book a **private place** to discuss sensitive topics
* [ ] Optional: bring **studies** and **data** if you want to prove a strong statement 

## During

* [ ] Define which is the best language to **communicate invitingly** with this person
    * Adapt your language to fit their context. Be clear and **direct**, but not rude.
* [ ] Use **work-appropriated** reasoning for your feedback
    * Explain why and how that is affecting the workplace.
* [ ] Give **examples to contextualize** what you mean 
    * Examples help ground us and contextualize the problems in time and space, instead of just being a hypothetical situation discussion.
* [ ] Mind your **tone** and **body language**
    * Think about the whole communication aspects and experience. Depending on how you phrase something, people will interpret the same information in very different ways.
* [ ] Focus on **how you feel** and speak about your own experience
    * Don't assume everyone looks at the same situation as you do. This way, you don’t annulate other life experiences, and you don’t sound arrogant. 
* [ ] **Show empathy** and share similar situations you've been through in the past

## After

* [ ] Make yourself **available to help**
* [ ] Offer possible ways to tackle the situation
* [ ] **Control your expectations** of how others will react or apply your feedback
    * You did your job, which was to make them aware. Now it’s on their hands, let go from pressuring them into submission or the need to be proven right.
* [ ] Optional: if they look for your guidance, make sure to **follow-up on their development**

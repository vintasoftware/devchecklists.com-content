## 1. Concept
  * [ ] Check if your app follows [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy): "Do one thing, and do it well".
  * [ ] Check if your app's description fits a few words. Examples:
    * [django-taggit](https://github.com/alex/django-taggit): django-taggit a simpler approach to tagging with Django.  
    * [django-js-reverse](https://github.com/ierror/django-js-reverse): Javascript URL handling for Django that doesn't hurt. 
    * [django-impersonate](https://bitbucket.org/petersanchez/django-impersonate): Simple application to allow superusers to "impersonate" other non-superuser accounts.  
  * [ ] Check if your app's description has the word "and", if so, try to break it in more apps.

## 2. Easy to install
  * [ ] Add a [LICENSE](https://choosealicense.com/) file.
  * [ ] [Distribute on PyPI:](https://packaging.python.org/distributing/)
    * [ ] Check for name clashes to avoid problems like [django-filter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-filter) vs [django-filters.](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-filters)
    * [ ] Use [Wheels.](https://packaging.python.org/distributing/#wheels)
  * [ ] Publish on [Django Packages.](https://djangopackages.org/)
  * [ ] Install dependencies automatically:
    * [ ] Add dependencies on `install_requires` on setup.py.
    * [ ] Don't add Django to `install_requires`.
    * [ ] Don't pin versions with `==` on `install_requires`. Use `>=`.
  * [ ] Check if you need a Django app or a regular Python package:
    * Django apps need to be added to `INSTALLED_APPS`. Regular Python packages do not. 
    * Examples of regular Python packages:  
      * [django-templated-email.](https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-templated-email)
      * [django-hashid-field.](https://github.com/nshafer/django-hashid-field)  
      * [django-downloadview.](https://github.com/benoitbryon/django-downloadview)  
  * [ ] Have sane and smart defaults:
    * [ ] Make it work by default.
    * [ ] Don't require copy and pasting of code snippets.
    * [ ] Don't do anything dangerous by default, like caching.
  * [ ] Require unsafe behavior to be explicit:
    * Don't show all if something isn't set, e.g., `fields = None` shouldn't mean all fields.
  * [ ] Have declarative settings to allow easy configuration:
    * [ ] Add a prefix to all settings of the app, like `MYAPP_SETTING_KEY`.
    * [ ] Convert hardcoded internal parameters to settings:
      * For example, `AVATAR_MAX_SIZE` of [django-avatar](http://django-avatar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#AVATAR_MAX_SIZE) could be hardcoded, but it's a setting.
    * [ ] If needed frequently by developers, allow behavior to be changed with just a change of settings.
    * [ ] If needed frequently by developers, accept custom classes and functions on settings via dotted path:
      * For example, [django-taggit](https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_tagging.html#using-a-custom-tag-string-parser) supports custom tag parsers via settings.
  * [ ] Support declarative pipelines for configurable workflows:
    * Check a implementation at [python-social-auth.](http://python-social-auth-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/django.html#personalized-configuration)
  * [ ] Provide default views with templates and URLs to allow the app to be easily included.
  * [ ] Have a friendly upgrade policy:
    * [ ] Deprecate before removing. Raise deprecation warnings, use Python [warnings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html) built-in module.
    * [ ] Don't rewrite migrations:
      * Users might depend on your old migration files because they ran it against their data in the past.
    * [ ] [Keep a CHANGELOG.](http://keepachangelog.com/)
    * [ ] Follow [Semantic Versioning.](http://semver.org/)
  * [ ] Give credit, have a [AUTHORS file:](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/AUTHORS)
    * Check this [script](https://kev.inburke.com/kevin/easy-maintenance-of-your-authors-file/) to generate AUTHORS file from git history.

## 3. Easy to use
  * [ ] Provide documentation:
    * [ ] Write docs first.
    * [ ] Have a README.
    * [ ] Provide a quick start tutorial describing the most common use case.
    * [ ] Separate high level from low-level docs.
    * [ ] Use gender neutral pronouns.
    * [ ] Host it in [Read the Docs.](http://readthedocs.org/)
  * [ ] Write tests:
    * [ ] Test with a [custom user model.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/#specifying-a-custom-user-model)
    * [ ] Provide [coverage.](http://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  * [ ] Have Continuous Integration:
    * [ ] Use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to test against various Python and Django versions.
      * Check tox.ini of popular projects like [django-filter](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter/blob/develop/tox.ini) and [django-taggit.](https://github.com/alex/django-taggit/blob/master/tox.ini)
    * [ ] Respect PEP 8, use [flake8.](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8)
  * [ ] Ship with an example project:
    * Examples of implementations:  
      * [django-guardian.](https://github.com/django-guardian/django-guardian/tree/devel/example_project)
      * [django-haystack.](https://github.com/django-haystack/django-haystack/tree/master/example_project)
      * [django-avatar.](https://github.com/grantmcconnaughey/django-avatar/tree/master/test_proj)
  * [ ] Separate Django abstractions into [commonly used filenames](https://gist.github.com/fjsj/65ecfec09cfd2a684d53294d01677b9b) like views.py, forms.py, fields.py, etc.
  * [ ] Follow the pattern `resource_action` in URLs names, like `password_reset` or `product_detail`.
  * [ ] Never rely on Django default user model, support [custom user models:](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/#specifying-a-custom-user-model)
    * Check a implementation at [django-registration.](http://django-registration.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom-user.html)
  * [ ] Provide declarative usage:
    * Examples of implementations:  
      * [django-filter filtersets.](https://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/develop/guide/usage.html#generating-filters-with-meta-fields)   
      * [django-import-export resources.](http://django-import-export.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#advanced-data-manipulation)
  * [ ] Don't connect code implicitly by name or module. Have a registry:
    * Examples of implementations:  
      * [django-contrib-comments moderator registry.](http://django-contrib-comments.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moderation.html#module-django_comments.moderation)  
      * [django-activity-stream registry.](http://django-activity-stream.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html)
  * [ ] Have management commands for common developer needs:
    * Examples of implementations:  
      * [django-reversion commands.](http://django-reversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html)  
      * [django-haystack commands.](http://django-haystack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)
  * [ ] Use `_default_manager`, not `objects`, when interacting with models of the host project.
  * [ ] Be Pythonic:
    * [ ] Use generators for lazy evaluation.
    * [ ] Use `with` statement contexts to deal with unmanaged resources.
  * [ ] Prevent errors:
    * [ ] Provide checks with [Django System check framework.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/checks/)
  * [ ] Fail-fast:
    * [ ] Raise `ImproperlyConfigured` if the developer makes a mistake on the config:
      * For example, [django-filter raises `ImproperlyConfigured`](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter/blob/0883cb6b25cd3bb2fa337fb9c54f0a3d2159f676/django_filters/views.py#L18-L28) when the developer forgets to specify `filterset_class` or `model` in a `FilterView`.
    * [ ] Raise `TypeError` or `ValueError` when the app gets an invalid argument.

- [ ] [Internationalize](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/) (I18N) your strings.

## 4. Easy to integrate
  * [ ] Reduce integration discontinuities:
    * [ ] Break class behaviors into methods.
    * [ ] Separate class behaviors into mixins.
    * [ ] Isolate logic into helper modules with business functions and classes.
  * [ ] Use [`AppConfig`:](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/applications/)
    * [ ] Make sure app doesn't break when AppConfig is extended.
  * [ ] Provide default templates:
    * [ ] Don't put them directly into `templates/`, put into `templates/app_name/`.
    * [ ] Guarantee they can be changed by loading a custom one with the same path.
  * [ ] Provide template tags for presenting complex data:
    * [ ] Leave only presentation logic into template tags, break the rest of logic into helpers.
      * For example, django-avatar has a `avatar` template tag to generate HTML `img` tags, but the logic to generate avatar URLs is [isolated at `providers.py`.](https://github.com/grantmcconnaughey/django-avatar/blob/master/avatar/providers.py)
  * [ ] Provide default views:
    * [ ] Don't break the configurability of class-based views, allow existing Django views attrs and methods to be overridden.
    * [ ] Break views common logic into mixins.
  * [ ] Avoid built-in models if possible:
    * [ ] If you need to have them, provide an abstract model and allow your app to work with a concrete custom variety. Examples of implementations:  
      * [django-taggit custom tag model.](https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_tagging.html#custom-tag)  
      * [django-blog-zinnia custom entry model.](http://docs.django-blog-zinnia.com/en/develop/how-to/extending_entry_model.html)  
      * [django-contrib-comments custom app.](https://django-contrib-comments.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom.html)
  * [ ] Break models common parts into abstract models.
  * [ ] Don't use model mixins, use abstract models:
    * Check the reason on this [StackOverflow answer.](http://stackoverflow.com/a/25817237/145349)
  * [ ] When using Generic Foreign Keys, allow them to be overridden by direct FKs. Examples of implementations:  
    * [django-guardian support of direct foreign keys.](http://django-guardian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/performance.html#direct-foreign-keys)  
    * [django-taggit support of custom through model.](https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_tagging.html#custom-foreignkeys)
  * [ ] Isolate form field logic into form fields and widgets:
    * Check a implementation at [django-recaptcha.](https://github.com/praekelt/django-recaptcha)
  * [ ] Isolate model field logic into model fields:
    * Check a implementation at [django-hashid-field.](https://github.com/nshafer/django-hashid-field)
  * [ ] Isolate query logic into queryset methods, like filter, update and delete logic.
  * [ ] Isolate table-level behavior logic into managers methods, like create logic.
  * [ ] Isolate validation logic into validators.
  * [ ] Use context processors only for global logic.
  * [ ] Use middlewares only for global logic related to request-response cycle or current user.
  * [ ] Avoid signals spaghetti code.

## 5. Maintenance
  * [ ] Be transparent about bugs, especially security issues:
    * [ ] Add security warnings to CHANGELOG, make sure they're parseable by [safety](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) tool.
  * [ ] Don't abandon the project, give it away.

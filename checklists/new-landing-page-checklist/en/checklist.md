description: Landing pages are usually detached from the original flow of your homepage
  and have a very specific point to make. This checklist helps remembering that and
  eventual ramifications when creating your own.

## Process
-  [ ] Are you sending your inbound traffic to a standalone landing page?
-  [ ] Is your landing page about only one subject?
-  [ ] In a five-second test, could anyone  tell what your page was about?
-  [ ] Did you test multiple versions of your web pages (A/B)?
-  [ ] Does the main headline on your landing match the message of your ads?
-  [ ] Do you use photos/videos of your product/service in the appropriate context?
-  [ ] Is your call to action above the fold?
-  [ ] Do you use design principles to make your call to action standout?
-  [ ] Are you only asking for essential information in your forms?
-  [ ] Does your call to action explicitly describe what you'll receive?
-  [ ] Have you removed unnecessary content from your page?
-  [ ] Are you using trust factors, such as testimonials or social media streams?
-  [ ] Is your call to action the most obvious thing on the page?
-  [ ] Have you removed all global navigation from your landing?
-  [ ] Are you presenting extra calls to action on your confirmation page?

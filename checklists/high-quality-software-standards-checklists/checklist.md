    * [ ] Deployment
    * [ ] Commands
    * [ ] Periodic jobs

* [ ] System Documentation
    * [ ] Complex business rules
    * [ ] Nontrivial design decisions
    * [ ] Known shortcomings
    * [ ] Third-party integrations documentation
* [ ] Easy onboarding process (eg. [Vinta's Playbook - Developer Onboarding](https://github.com/vintasoftware/playbook/blob/89810e160c8bfb65de63237d2dc8a910ff265e5d/checklists/developer_onboarding.md))
* [ ] Loosely coupled architecture. [More details](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/devops-culture-and-mindset/the-importance-of-loosely-coupled-architecture-teams-eEmIN)
* [ ] Configuration stored in environment. [More details](https://12factor.net/config)
* [ ] Logging standards facilitating search and protecting user data:
    * [ ] Logs are prefixed according to task/feature
    * [ ] No sensitive data is being logged 
* [ ] Small batches of work
* [ ] Continuous testing (i.e., the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline)
* [ ] Continuous integration
* [ ] Code coverage above 80%
* [ ] Code review standards, including frequent small PRs. [More details here](https://devchecklists.com/pull-requests-checklist/) and [here](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/code-review-guidelines/)
* [ ] Safe automated deployment pipeline, including protected Master branches
* [ ] Deployment frequency between one day and one week
* [ ] Lead time for changes between one day and one week s (i.e., how long it takes to go from code committed to code in production)
* [ ] Time to restore service is less than one day
* [ ] Change failure rate between 0-15%
* [ ] High availability
* [ ] Error tracking tools (eg. [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/))
* [ ] Monitoring tools (eg. [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), [Librato](https://www.librato.com/))
* [ ] Security 
    * [ ] Destructive actions prompt confirmations
    * [ ] Follows the principle of least privilege: block resources/actions by default (whitelist when permission is needed)
    * [ ] Has static code analyzers to find security flaws (eg: eslint-plugin-security, eslint-plugin-react)
    * [ ] Has dependency vulnerability checkers in place (eg: Python safety, npm audit)
    * [ ] Promotes privacy and raises awareness on users and stakeholders
* [ ] Development, Staging and Production environments as similar as possible, while asserting user data protecting through anonymization. [More details](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d1AEIg9_GLCL62E8Nkfcu4W5UyNXK8mR8ynDqcaomMo/edit)

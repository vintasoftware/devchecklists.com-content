title: Sprint Meeting Checklist

## Process
- [ ] Check with everyone if Trello represents what has been and shall be done.
- [ ] Remember to report to the client the value that is being delivered (faster loading speed, less crashes, improved security/safety) from that sprint instead of technical stuff (do that only if necessary).
- [ ] Report things that are going well. Celebrate success.
- [ ] Report problems being faced.
- [ ] Report risks and known issues. Discuss how to address them.
- [ ] Talk about next steps.
- [ ] Ask about unclear topics. 
- [ ] Ask about client expectations on what is being and will be done. Check if progress is aligned with budget and schedule expectations.
- [ ] Always ask about priorities and discuss if there is something more important than what is being worked on. 
- [ ] Take notes during meeting, use a service you can save online like Google Docs.
- [ ] After meeting, add notes to a Trello card under  Documents column and update other cards if necessary.
- [ ] After meeting, if you said you would send something to client, track it.

## Follow the steps above to create and add your checklist

* [ ] Fork this repository;
* [ ] Create a new folder inside of `/checklists` to contain your checklist
  * The folder name will be used to create the link - EG: for a folder called my-brand-new-checklist, the checklist will be on devchecklists.com/my-brand-new-checklist
* [ ] Inside the new folder you just created, created folders for each language the checklist will be available, using the [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for the language as the folder name
  * If the checklist is only available on english, the folder name would be `en`
* [ ] Create a `checklist.md` with your checklist inside each language folder
  * Some examples you can use:
    * The example checklist.md
    * This checklist!
* [ ] Create a [new pull request](https://github.com/vintasoftware/devchecklists.com-content/pulls) to submit your checklist for approval.
